<h3>Progress Update - Dec. 25th, 2020 [<a id=u3 href="#u3">permalink</a>]</h3>
<section style="background: lightyellow">
<u>Author: Ryan Jacobs</u>

<h4>Happy Holidays!</h4>
<p>
First of all, I want to wish everyone a relaxing winter break.
</p>
<p>
I am taking a couple weeks off my dayjob to help onboard new users.
Response time via email should be less than 24 hours. Feel free to
email directly or make post on our
<a href="https://github.com/radious-subsystems/zfs.rent/discussions">
GitHub discussion board</a>.
</p>

<h4>Open-Source</h4>
<p>
In the spirit of transparency and longevity, we are open-sourcing
our software, database schemas, and runbooks.
</p>

<h4>Commitment to Communication</h4>
<p>
It has been about two weeks since our last public update. In the mean time,
we have on-boarded several users and gathered feedback. From here on out,
there will be a weekly update posted on Fridays. In addition, minor status
updates may be posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/radious__">our Twitter</a>.
</p>

<h4>API</h4>
<p>
As we mentioned in our
<a href="https://radious.co/philosophy.txt">philosophy.txt</a>
document, we strive for an API-first system. Everything exposed on our
dashboards/graphs can be called directly over JSON over HTTP APIs.
</p>
<p>
The current API is being fleshed out. But please check out these two endpoints
for hypervisor #1:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://api.zfs.rent/v0/status/drives/hvm1.json">api.zfs.rent/v0/status/drives/hvm1.json</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://api.zfs.rent/v0/status/bandwidth/hvm1.json">api.zfs.rent/v0/status/bandwidth/hvm1.json</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Similar endpoints exist for user data, (e.g. your own drive temperature
stats and bandwidth usage.)
</p>

<h4>Accounts</h4>
<p>
In order to simplify our on-boarding process, we have decided to use email-based
auth codes for the time being. If you do not have account, simply enter your
email in the login dashboard and one will be created for you automatically. A
corresponding API key will be created for you automatically.
</p>

<h4>Roadblocks: Software, Hardware, and Logistics</h4>
<p>
Here are a few roadblocks (and solutions!) we have encountered over the past
two weeks.
</p>
<hr>

<h4>Hardware Issue #1 - Temperature</h4>
<p>
Shortly after launch, we assembled a 2x 8TB system in a small 1U chassis
to benchmark disk speeds and log temperatures within the datacenter.
Unfortunately, cooling was an issue. We did not install any fans directed at
the drives. (Note: "m2_drive" refers to "machine-2", not the M.2 device
standard.) The cyclical spikes you are seeing correspond to the datacenter's
ambient temperature day/night cycle. Next trip, I plan to install some ambient
temperature sensors in the rack.
</p>
<div align=center>
  <img src="https://notryan.com/img?filename=m2_drive.png"
       title="Plot of 1U-Chassis Drive Temperatures (X=Time, Y=Temperature_Degrees_C)">
</div>
<p>
These issues have been mitigated with our 4U chassis. In each chassis,
we install five pressure-optimized fans in a push-pull configuration. There
are three intake fans that push air directly into the drive cages. Each drive
is separated by roughly 0.25 inches and the air flows through them, like
fins. At the rear of the chassis, two exhaust fans accelerate the airflow.
</p>
<div align=center>
  <img src="https://notryan.com/img?filename=h1_drives.png"
       title="Plot of 4U-Chassis Drive Temperatures (X=Time, Y=Temperature_Degrees_C)">
</div>
<p>
With the new fans and larger chassis, the drive temperatures are in a
reasonable range!
</p>
<p>
These plots are regenerated every 5 minutes. The backend software will be
open-sourced generically at:
<a href="https://github.com/radious-subsystems/metrics">radious-subsystems/metrics</a>.
(Note: the repo hasn't been made public yet. But it will be soon!)
</p>

<h4>Logistics Issue #1 - Processor Stock</h4>
<p>
It was bad timing to launch a hardware-centric business in the midst of
an ongoing silicon shortage.
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/if-important-components-will-become-shortage-cpus-gpus-console-chips-and-other-components-as-complex-handle-object/">igorslab.de</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN28R0ZL">reuters.com</a></li>
</ul>
We pivoted to Intel-based systems instead of AMD in order to meet demand. This
has increased our costs slightly, but end-user performance should be roughly
the same.
</p>
<hr>

<h4>Software Issue #1 - CentOS 8.2 Redacts 2029 LTS (Long-Term Support)</h4>
<p>
In other news, IBM/RedHat have recently dropped their 2029 LTS timeline for
CentOS 8.... which is a real bummer. Additionally, their upgrade to CentOS 8.3
broke new OpenZFS 0.8.5 installs. In the interim, we installed ZFS 2.0.0 on
several systems and has been working smoothly. The ZFS team has a fairly
solid track record of cautious updates and I trust 2.0.0 not to break anything.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, the OpenZFS devs are quick. Within two weeks, ZFS 0.8.6 now
installs on CentOS 8.3 without any additional effort.
</p>

<h4>Software Issue #2 - DHCP firewalling</h4>
<p>This is a royal pain-in-the-ass because of Linux raw sockets.
(<a href="https://superuser.com/a/1457487">https://superuser.com/a/1457487</a>)
</p>
<p>
DHCP requests and responses skip over iptables and ebtables rules. I plan
on doing a write-up of our solution in the docs later on. We use DHCP to
map static IPs to each VM's mac address. The nice thing about the standard
NIC para-virtualization is that it prevents the guests from modifying
their mac address.

<p>
Eh... I thought this ER diagram generator made the DB schema look slick, so
I'd might as well post it. All of our base entities are tracked in the database.
It records their power usage, bandwidth consumption, temperature, etc.

<p>
I'm going to port over a project that I've been working on to plot lightweight
.png graphs of the systems.
(<a href="//notryan.com/vast">example 1</a>, <a href="//notryan.com/status">example 2</a>)
Look ma! No JS!

<p>
(Axes labels will be added to the zfs.rent graphs of course.)
